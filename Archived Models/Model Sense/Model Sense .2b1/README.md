# About Z## Files

I have split the files into 20MB archives, all you have to do is just extract the zip file normally to get the `.safetensors` file normally, this is done to reduce the file size



Make sure you have all `Z##` files from `Z01` to `Z19` as well as `model.zip`

Keep the `config.json`, without it you won't be able to use the model
