# NN Features Directory

This directory contains various files and visualizations related to the neural network model and vectorizer used in the project. Below is a description of each file and folder:

## Files

- `Neural Network Nodes Graph.gexf`: A Gephi file that contains the model nodes and edges.
  - `Nodes and edges (GEPHI).csv`: A CSV file that contains the model nodes and edges.
  - `Statistics`: Directories made by Gephi, containing the statistics of the model nodes and edges.
- `Feature_Importance.svg`: A SVG file that contains the feature importance of the model.
- `Loss_Landscape_3D.html`: A HTML file that contains the 3D loss landscape of the model.
- `Model Accuracy Over Epochs.png` and `Model Loss Over Epochs.png`: PNG files that contain the model accuracy and loss over epochs.
- `Model state dictionary.txt`: A text file that contains the model state dictionary.
- `Model Summary.txt`: A text file that contains the model summary.
- `Model Visualization.png`: A PNG file that contains the model visualization.
- `Top_90_Features.svg`: A SVG file that contains the top 90 features of the model.
- `Vectorizer features.txt`: A text file that contains the vectorizer features.
- `Visualize Activation.png`: A PNG file that contains the visualization of the model activation.
- `Visualize t-SNE.png`: A PNG file that contains the visualization of the model t-SNE.
- `Weight Distribution.png`: A PNG file that contains the weight distribution of the model.



There may be more, but you may attempt to discover them yourself.


## Usage

To generate the files and visualizations, run the `_study_network.py` script. Ensure that the model and vectorizer files are present in the specified paths as mentioned in the script.
